# DSA Practice

This repository contains my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice in multiple languages, organized for progressive learning and interview preparation.

## Structure

- **DSA-In-C&C++/**
  - `01-Basics/` — C++ basics and fundamental DSA concepts.
  - `02-STL/` — Practice with C++ Standard Template Library (STL).
  - `03-DSA-Problems/` — DSA problems solved in C++.

- **DSA-In-JS&TS/**
  - `DSA-Problems/` — DSA problems solved in JavaScript and TypeScript.

- **DSA-In-Python/**
  - `DSA-Problems/` — DSA problems solved in Python.

- **DSA-SDE-Sheet/**
  - `DSA Sheet.pdf` — Reference SDE sheet for interview preparation.
  - Subfolders (e.g., `1-Arrays/`, `2-Strings/`, ...) — Solutions to SDE sheet problems, organized by topic.

## How to Use

- Browse each folder for topic-wise solutions and code samples.
- Use the SDE Sheet folder for focused interview prep.
- Refer to the STL folder for idiomatic C++ solutions.
